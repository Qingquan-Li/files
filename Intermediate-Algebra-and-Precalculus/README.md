# About this Course

This course prepares you for Calculus and introduces you to the different types of mathematical functions that you will encounter in that course. Additionally, it builds your skills in algebra, primarily solving the types of equations that come up in Calculus. I believe that the math you will learn in this course is interesting, but mathematics is a matter of taste. Many students are taking this course as a requirement for their major. While not all of the math you learn in this course will be directly applicable to your eventual career, by passing this course and Calculus you prove to a prospective employer that you have what it takes to solve difficult problems and complete challenging projects. I believe that this is one way to appreciate the importance of this course in the curriculum.


# Introduction

PreCalculus is so-named because it’s designed as a preparation for Calculus, which has been a classical part of college math curricula for hundreds of years. Calculus was invented or discovered by Issac Newton over 300 years ago, and it deals with rates of change of quantities. It’s used to solve problems in economics, finance, and physics, and is a great course, one that I also teach. The basic subject of calculus is this thing called a “function”, which is basically a mathematical formula. This course, PreCalculus, is all about functions. We’re going to introduce the most important kinds of functions, learn how to graph them, which is to understand them visually, and we’re going to look into real-life contexts that they show up in. So that’s the basic structure of the course—what are the different kinds of mathematical formulas, what do they look like graphically, and how are they useful.

To succeed in PreCalculus (and the next course, Calculus) requires being able to solve many different kinds of math problems. Nearly all of these problems require techniques that are based on Algebra, which you can think of as the logical language of math. Without strong algebra skills, you may understand the concepts but still not succeed at solving the problems.
